# Description

Often times a contracting authority (mostly businesses) are seeking a specific contractor for a single task. This could be a fashion brand looking for influencers with a reach of more than 10,000 followers to promote pre-defined products in a set of pre-defined posts. 

The business can employ several of those contractors for different services. The terms of each contract, most importantly the payment amount for the service, needs to be private to avoid disputes between contractors who received varying terms - which happens often in reality. 

Using the DSID Shielder, the fashion brand can easily find an influencer that 

- verifiably fulfils all requirements for the job,
- setup an on-chain payment scheme based on private smart contracts and
- make sure the payment is released only upon successful completion of the job.

The Shielder makes sure that a contractor can only start a job if specific criteria defined by the contracting authority are met. The Shielder additionally makes sure payments can’t be traced back to the contracting authority and that they are automatically facilitated when a job is fulfilled. 

In our example of the fashion brand, the influencer who met the pre-defined criteria of >10,000 followers and verified it on-chain before claiming the job, will have to promote the products the job asked for and eventually input the links to those posts for DSID to verify completion of the job. He will receive payment to his wallet address after.
